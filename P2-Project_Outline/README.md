## Submission Instructions

### Overview

 Khan Academy Reports
 KHReports is an web and mobile application that allows users (targeting coaches, teachers and parents) to access data from Khan Academys API and create custom reports for use in various situations. The app will allow users to login, request and authorize access to other users data that are already listed as a student or child of the current logged in user. From there they can use the provided report formats or customize reports for their needs. Reports will be generated PDF's that can be printed, sent to an email address or saved to local or online storage services like DropBox or Google Drive.

### Features

Multi-sign-in options using Oauth2 including social medial and email accounts. In addition, if the user is already signed into Khan Academy a token will be created to automatically sign users into KHReports
Ability to create custom reports with data acessed through Khan Academy's API
Ability to print reports to any accessible printer and/or download to local storage
Ability to save reports to cloud storage like DropBox or Google Drive
Ability to request and authorize access to other users data

*Possible feature to save report formts for faster report creation that would require database creation

### Technologies

The technologies I plan to use are React with Redux and convert that to a React Native mobile app. Though I am also considering just creating an Android mobile app as well.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll have to learn the React and React Native frameworks. I will have to learn mobile printint setup. I've have limited experience with Android development so I would learn a lot there.
